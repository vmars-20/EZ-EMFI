# Session Handoff Documentation

**Purpose**: Intermediate documentation created during DS1140-PD development to enable context-efficient LLM collaboration.

## What is a Session Handoff?

When working with LLMs (like Claude Code), context window limits mean you can't keep all information in memory indefinitely. **Session handoffs** are structured documents that:

1. Summarize what's been completed
2. Provide clear next steps
3. Include quick-start prompts for fresh sessions
4. Reference all relevant files and decisions

These documents enable **continuous development** across multiple LLM sessions without losing context or momentum.

## DS1140-PD Session Handoffs

### 1. Layer 1 (Top.vhd) Handoff
**File**: `DS1140_PD_LAYER1_HANDOFF.md`

**Context**: After completing Phases 0-4 (VHDL Layers 2 & 3, all tests passing), this handoff guided the next session to create Top.vhd (Layer 1).

**Contents**:
- Quick start prompt for new Claude session
- Complete implementation status (what's done, what's next)
- Top.vhd template with three-output architecture
- Key differences from DS1120-PD reference
- Testing status (all 10 tests passing)
- Success criteria and timeline

**Outcome**: Top.vhd successfully created in ~30 minutes in fresh session

## Why This Pattern Works

### Benefits of Session Handoffs:

1. **Context Preservation**: Critical decisions and design rationale documented
2. **Efficiency**: New session can start immediately without re-discovering architecture
3. **Collaboration**: Team members can pick up work with clear guidance
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Documents serve as implementation case studies

### When to Create a Handoff:

- ✅ Approaching context window limit (>70%)
- ✅ Natural phase boundary (e.g., Layer 2/3 complete → Layer 1 next)
- ✅ Complex next step requiring fresh context
- ✅ Want to preserve design decisions for team

### Handoff Document Structure:

```markdown
# [Component] Implementation Handoff

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Ready for [next phase]
**Context**: [Why this handoff exists]

## Quick Start Prompt for New Session
[Copy-paste prompt with @file references]

## Implementation Status
[What's done, what's next]

## Key Implementation Details
[Critical design decisions, code snippets]

## Success Criteria
[How to know next phase is complete]
```

## Other Examples in This Repository

While DS1140-PD was the first to use formal session handoffs, similar patterns appear in:

- **Phase transition docs** (PHASE0_HANDOFF.md, PHASE2-TODO.md)
- **Continuation prompts** (for resuming after interruption)
- **Design decision documents** (DS1140_PD_THREE_OUTPUT_DESIGN.md)

All serve the same purpose: **enable effective LLM collaboration across context boundaries**.

## Using These Handoffs for Your Projects

### Template for Your Handoff:

1. **Start with status summary**: What's complete, what's blocked, what's next
2. **Include quick-start prompt**: Exact text for new LLM session
3. **Reference critical files**: Use `@filename` notation for clarity
4. **Document key decisions**: Why you chose this approach
5. **Provide success criteria**: How to verify next phase

### Tips for Effective Handoffs:

- **Be specific**: "Create Top.vhd with 3 outputs" not "finish the project"
- **Include code snippets**: Show exact patterns to follow
- **Reference files by path**: `/Users/vmars20/EZ-EMFI/VHDL/Top.vhd`
- **Estimate time**: Helps scope the next session
- **Test your prompt**: Could someone else pick this up?

**Key Insight**: Good documentation enables **handoffs to yourself** (future you with limited context) and **handoffs to others** (team members or LLMs).
